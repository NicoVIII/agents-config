description: Assess and safely merge Dependabot PRs in the current repo — merge bumps that green CI with a real test suite actually verifies, flag the rest with test or manual-verification guidance. Use when I ask to merge/triage Dependabot PRs, clear dependency bumps, or handle bot dependency updates in this repo.
---

Assess the current repo's open Dependabot PRs, merge the ones a real test suite actually verifies, and flag the rest with a way to make them safe.

Scope is the current repo only. `prioritize` finds *which* repos have bumps waiting; this handles *one* repo's bumps in depth — run it after you've cd'd into the target.

## Gather

Run these once for the repo (batch the independent ones):

- Open Dependabot PRs: `gh pr list --author 'app/dependabot' --state open --json number,title,headRefName,mergeable,isDraft,statusCheckRollup`. No results → say so and stop. Do **not** request `body` in the bulk list — Dependabot bodies embed full release notes and blow up the output. When you need a PR's bumped-member lines or changelog links, fetch per PR: `gh pr view <n> --json body -q .body | grep -E '^Update(s|d) '` (npm-style bodies say ``Updates `x` ``, nuget-style say `Updated [x]`).
- Allowed merge method: `gh repo view --json squashMergeAllowed,mergeCommitAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed`. Prefer squash → merge → rebase.
- **Does CI run a real test suite?** Read `.github/workflows/*.{yml,yaml}` and look for a genuine test-runner step (`npm test`, `pytest`, `jest`, `vitest`, `go test`, `cargo test`, `dotnet test`, `mvn test`, …) — *not* lint / typecheck / build / format alone. This is the load-bearing check: if no workflow runs tests, green CI proves nothing and **every** bump is flagged as unverified. Decide this once; it applies to all PRs.
- **Repo policy.** Read `.github/dependabot.yml` if present for `ignore` rules and directory scoping. A bump matching an ignore rule shouldn't have been opened — treat it as policy-flagged (below), not safe.
- **Mergeability is unreliable in the bulk list** — `mergeable` comes back `UNKNOWN` for most PRs (GitHub computes it lazily). Re-query per PR: `gh pr view <n> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`. Read `mergeStateStatus`: `DIRTY`/`CONFLICTING` = needs rebase, `BLOCKED` = branch protection, `UNSTABLE` = a check failed, `BEHIND` = out of date, `CLEAN` = good.

## Classify

Per PR, in order — first match wins:

1. **CI not green** — any check FAILURE/ERROR/CANCELLED → `✗ red CI`. Name the failing check and a one-line excerpt (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`). Old runs expire: `--log-failed` returns HTTP 410 once logs are gone. When the excerpt is unavailable — or the run predates the repo's current toolchain (stale PR) — say so and recommend `@dependabot rebase` to regenerate CI rather than chasing a gone log. A broken bump needs code changes, not tests — out of scope here; flag and move on.
2. **Checks still pending** → `⏳ pending` — skip this run, no verdict yet.
3. **No real test suite** (from Gather) → `⚠ unverified` — green CI is meaningless without tests.
4. **Not mergeable** (`mergeStateStatus` is `DIRTY`/`CONFLICTING`) → `⚠ needs rebase` — note `@dependabot rebase`; do not merge.
5. **Major bump** → `⚠ major` — breaking by design; tests rarely cover intentional breakage. Treat a PR as major if any bumped dependency crosses a major version, **or** crosses a pre-1.0 minor (`0.27 → 0.28`, `0.x → 1.0`) since pre-1.0 minors can break. For grouped PRs the highest-risk member decides (worst-member wins) — parse each `Update(s|d) x from A to B` line in the body, not just the title. The body can be stale: before classifying a grouped or lockfile-only PR by its body versions, confirm with `gh pr diff <n> --name-only` that a manifest file actually changes. A diff touching only the lockfile, with the resolved version staying inside the existing manifest range, is not the bump the body claims — treat it as a stale refresh, check whether another open PR bumps the same dependency (it's likely superseded; see Unstick), and don't flag it major on the body's say-so.
6. **Contradicts repo policy** → `⚠ policy` — even green + minor. A bump matching a `.github/dependabot.yml` ignore rule shouldn't merge (likely a config gap — offer to close it). For a **library**, also be wary of bumps that raise a dependency floor consumers must match (target framework, `FSharp.Core`, a declared minimum) — the library should keep working against the *old* version, so verify compatibility instead of bumping. Flag; do not merge.
7. Otherwise (**green + real tests + patch/minor + mergeable + no policy conflict**) → `✓ safe`.

## Present & merge

List safe PRs, then flagged PRs grouped by reason. Ask **once** to merge the safe batch. If no PR is safe, say so, skip the merge ask, and go straight to the flagged report and the unstick confirmation — one question total. On confirmation, merge each with the repo's method and delete the branch: `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch` (swap `--squash` for `--merge`/`--rebase` per Gather). Never touch a flagged PR.

For each **flagged** PR, make it actionable — state the reason, then:

- **major / unverified:** grep the repo for the package's import/use sites (`rg <package>`), link the changelog/release notes from the PR body, and give a targeted manual-test suggestion for those sites plus what a covering test would assert. Do **not** write test files — this is guidance; `/verify-bump <n>` is the skill that actually runs it.
- **red CI:** the failing check + excerpt is enough; the fix is code, which you'd start deliberately.
- **needs rebase / pending:** the one-line note is enough.
- **policy:** say which rule it hits and offer to close it (`gh pr close <n> --comment ...`); if it exposes a config gap — an ignore rule that should exist but doesn't — say so.

Whenever you write anything to GitHub on my behalf — a close comment, a posted `@dependabot rebase` request, a review — end it with a short marker that an agent wrote it (e.g. "— written by an agent"), per my attribution norms. Merges and branch deletions carry their own authorship and need no marker.

Keep it dense — one verdict block per PR, no padding. Example:

```
✓ safe (3) — merge these?
  jest 29.6→29.7 · lodash 4.17.20→4.17.21 · npm group (2 minor)
⚠ major axios 0.27→1.0 — breaking by design
  used in: src/api/client.ts, src/auth.ts · changelog: <link>
  manual: exercise login + a GET; assert error shape (axios reworked errors)
  test gap: no test hits src/api/client.ts
✗ typescript 5.2→5.3 — CI red: `tsc`, 2 type errors in src/db.ts (excerpt) — needs code changes
⚠ policy FSharp.Core 10.0→10.1 — matches dependabot.yml ignore (/src); library must stay compatible with the old floor — close?
```

## Unstick

After reporting, collect the mechanical unstick actions and offer them as one batch (a second confirmation, separate from the merge batch):

- Post `@dependabot rebase` (via `gh pr comment`) on each PR flagged needs-rebase, and on red-CI PRs whose logs have expired or whose last run used a stale toolchain — a fresh run beats chasing a gone log.
- Close superseded PRs: when two open bot PRs bump the same dependency, the one targeting the lower version is superseded — close it in favor of the survivor (`gh pr close <n> --comment ...`).

On confirmation fire the batch, report what was posted and closed, and end — never wait or poll for the fresh CI runs; the next `merge-dependabot` run picks up the results.

Stop after merging the safe batch, reporting the flagged ones, and firing any confirmed unstick batch. Don't start fixing broken bumps or writing tests unless I ask — deep verification of a single flagged bump is `/verify-bump`'s job.

This skill is not yet battle-tested: if any instruction above was ambiguous, wrong, or needed a workaround, say so briefly at the end of the run.
